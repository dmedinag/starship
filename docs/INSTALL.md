## ðŸš€ Installation (extended)

There are so many platforms out there that they don't fit into a single
README.md file, so here are some installation instructions for other platforms
from the community. Is yours not here? Please do add it here if you figure it
out!

1. Installing the **starship** binary:

   ##### From source on [crates.io](https://crates.io/):

   ```sh
   cargo install starship
   ```

   ### With [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix):

   #### Imperatively

   ```sh
   nix-env -iA nixos.starship
   ```

   #### Declarative, single user, via [home-manager](home-manager)

   Add `pkgs.starship` to your `home.packages` in your `home.nix` file, then run

   ```sh
   home-manager switch
   ```

   #### Declarative, system-wide, with NixOS

   Add `pkgs.starship` to `environment.packages` in your `configuration.nix`,
   then run

   ```sh
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch
   ```

2. Adding the init script to your shell's config file

   ### With Nix and home-manager, using zsh:

   Add the following to `programs.zsh.initExtra` in your `home.nix` file, then
   run

   ```sh
   home-manager switch
   ```
